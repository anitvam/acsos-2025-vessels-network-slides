## Exercise:

* *Fork* the repository at: https://github.com/APICe-at-DISI/OOP-git-merge-conflict-test
* *Clone* the repository locally
* *Merge* the branch `feature` into `master`
* There will be a *conflict*!
  * If you know Java, solve it in such a way that the program prints both the author and the number of processors
  * If you don't, edit the file to make it appear like something that could work
* Once the file has the look you want, *complete the merge*
* *Push* to your fork
* *Observe* that you can open a pull request
  * Do not open it, or at least not towards the original repository
  * (I won't pull anyway ;) )
