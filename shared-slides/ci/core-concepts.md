# Core concepts

Naming and organization is variable across platforms, but *in general*:

* One or more **pipelines** can be associated to **events**
  * For instance, a *new commit*, an update to a *pull request*, or a *timeout*
* Every pipeline is composed of a **sequence** of **operations**
* Every **operation** could be composed of sequential or parallel **sub-operations**
* How many hierarchical levels are available depends on the specific platform
  * GitHub Actions: *workflow* $\Rightarrow$ *job* $\Rightarrow$ *step*
  * Travis CI: *build* $\Rightarrow$ *stage* $\Rightarrow$ *job*  $\Rightarrow$ *phase*
* Execution happens in a **fresh system** (virtual machine or container)
  * Often containers inside virtual machines
  * The specific point of the hierarchy at which the VM/container is spawned depends on the CI platform

## Pipeline design

In essence, designing a CI system is designing a software construction, verification, and delivery *pipeline*
with the abstractions provided by the selected provider.

1. **Think** of all the operations required starting from one or more *blank* VMs
    * OS configuration
    * Software installation
    * Project checkout
    * Compilation
    * Testing
    * Secrets configuration
    * Delivery
    * ...
2. **Organize** them in a dependency graph
3. **Model** the graph with the provided CI tooling

Configuration can grow complex, and is usually stored in a YAML file
<br>
(but there are exceptions, JetBrains TeamCity uses a Kotlin DSL).
